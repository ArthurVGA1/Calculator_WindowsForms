This exercise serves as a practical training ground for honing Windows Forms skills. While currently a basic calculator, the intention is to elevate its functionality to encompass a broader spectrum. The envisioned enhancements include transforming it into a scientific calculator, integrating features for currency conversion, and enabling the conversion of binary, hexadecimal, and octal numbers. Furthermore, there is a commitment to refining its visual aesthetics for a more polished appearance.
